This repository contains scripts for bulk analysis of microscopy images in FIJI/ImageJ:

* **nuclei_stardist_sorted.py**: A Jython script for StarDist-based nuclei segmentation macro
* **intensity.py**: A Jython script for quantitative intensity measurements
* **positiv\_negativ.py**: A Jython script for positive/negative classification based on measured intensities

## StarDist Batch Analysis

Automated segmentation and analysis of cell nuclei in bulk using StarDist and Bio-Formats.

### Features

* **Automatic Parameter Configuration**: Prompts for model, probability & NMS thresholds, tiling, channel patterns, and size filters.
* **Channel Detection**: Identifies target channel(s) (e.g. DAPI) via customizable patterns.
* **Size Filtering**: Applies minimum/maximum label size to exclude artifacts.
* **StarDist Segmentation**: Runs headless StarDist for label image generation.
* **Morphology Measurement**: Measures area and circularity for each object.
* **CSV Export**: Generates `nuclei_counts.csv` (summary) and `nuclei_morphology.csv` (per-object data).
* **Batch Processing**: Processes all supported image files in a folder, including multi-series imports.

### Installation

1. Install FIJI/ImageJ (JavaÂ 8+).
2. Ensure the following plugins are installed:

   * Bio-Formats (for ND2/LIF/TIFF import)
   * StarDist plugin
   * MorphoLibJ and  IJPB-plugin (for morphological operations)
   * Jython (included with FIJI)
3. Place the scripts in your FIJI scripts directory.
4. Restart FIJI.

### Configuration

Edit the top of `nuclei_stardist_sorted.py` for hardcoded defaults:

```java
model = "Versatile (fluorescent nuclei)"
probability_thresh = 0.5
nms_thresh = 0.5
tiles_str = "1,1"
channel_patterns_str = "c1-,dapi"
min_label_size = 50
max_label_size = 2500
```

### Usage

1. Open FIJI > **Plugins > Scripting > Open...**
2. Select and run `nuclei_stardist_sorted.py.
3. Configure parameters in the dialog prompts.
4. Choose the folder containing your images.
5. Wait for processing; progress appears in the console.

### Output

* **Annotated label windows** (auto-closed)
* `nuclei_counts.csv` (image name, nuclei count)
* `nuclei_morphology.csv` (image name, object index, area, roundness)

### CSV Format

| Column                      | Description                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Image                       | Filename or series identifier   |
| Nuclei\_Count               | Total number of detected nuclei |
| Object (nuclei\_morphology) | Object index (per image)        |
| Area                        | Object area in pixels           |
| Roundness                   | Object circularity metric       |

## Intensity Measurement (`intensity.py`)

Measures integrated intensities of marker channels on a per-series and per-well basis.

### Features

* **Interactive Configuration**: Prompts for marker channel patterns, thresholding (automatic or fixed), background subtraction, heatmap generation, and window closing.
* **Background Subtraction**: Rolling-ball radius, repetitions, median filter, or defaults.
* **Thresholding**: Automatic (Otsu, Yen, Moments) with scaling factor or fixed value.
* **CSV Export**: `intensity_measurements.csv` (per-series) and `intensity_measurements_per_well.csv` (aggregated per-well).
* **Optional Heatmaps**: Pseudocolor heatmaps saved as PNGs in a `heatmaps/` subfolder.
* **Batch Processing**: Handles multi-series files and all supported formats.

### Usage

1. In FIJI, go to **Plugins > Scripting > Run...** and select `intensity.py`.
2. Follow the prompts:

   1. Marker channel pattern(s)
   2. Automatic thresholding? If yes, choose method and scaling; otherwise, enter fixed value.
   3. Background subtraction? If yes, choose custom or default settings.
   4. Generate heatmaps? Yes/No.
   5. Close images after processing? Yes/No.
3. Select the folder with your images.
4. Wait for processing; progress appears in the console.

### Output

* `intensity_measurements.csv` (per-series: positive pixels, mean intensity, integrated intensity, nuclei count, normalized intensity)
* `intensity_measurements_per_well.csv` (aggregated per-well metrics)
* Optional heatmaps in `heatmaps/` if enabled.

## Positive/Negative Classification (`positiv_negativ.py`)

Classifies wells/images as positive or negative based on thresholded normalized intensity.

### Features

* **Threshold-based Classification**: Applies user-defined threshold on normalized intensity.
* **CSV I/O**: Reads `intensity_measurements_per_well.csv` and writes `well_classification.csv`.
* **Simple Workflow**: Prompts for threshold value and input folder.

### Usage

1. In FIJI, run `positiv_negativ.py` via **Plugins > Scripting > Run...**
2. Enter the threshold and select the folder with CSV files.
3. The script outputs `well_classification.csv` to the same folder.
